Quick examples of how to make movies, for presentation at the CU Boulder APS Hack Day on 11/15/2019.

If you want to follow along, it will help to have `ffmpeg` installed. This allows you to make an `.mp4` movie file, which will be faster to make and have much better compression than an animated `.gif`. To install it, run
```
conda install ffmpeg
```
from your terminal or Anaconda prompt.

It may also help to have `tqdm` to get a handy status bar for long animations. To install it, run
```
pip install tqdm
```
from your terminal or Anaconda prompt.
